# A forgotten g2-standard-4 is real, ongoing money. This is the backstop for what the
# idle watchdog cannot cover: an instance genuinely busy doing something you forgot
# you started, or storage cost drifting up on its own. Same purpose as the AWS
# module's aws_budgets_budget — the mechanics differ more than the syntax, though:
#
# - AWS Budgets emails a plain address directly. GCP billing budgets notify every
#   principal with a Billing Account Administrator/User IAM role by default — that
#   happens with NO extra resource below, automatically, the moment a budget exists.
# - A specific extra address (budget_alert_email) needs its own Cloud Monitoring
#   notification channel, created here and attached via all_updates_rule — an
#   AWS Budgets subscriber list has no equivalent extra resource to create.
