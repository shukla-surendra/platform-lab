"""
Contrastive self-supervised objective (SimCSE-style) built on top of the *unchanged*
causal TinyStoriesGPT from model.py — not a new backbone architecture. This is how real
causal-LM-based embedding models work (E5-mistral, LLM2Vec, GTR): take a decoder-only
model that was never trained as an encoder, pool a hidden state from it, and train a small
projection head on top with a contrastive objective. See docs/CONTRASTIVE_LEARNING.md for
the full mechanism and why this differs from a from-scratch bidirectional encoder (which is
what model_mlm.py builds for a different, unrelated reason).

The positive-pair trick (SimCSE, Gao et al. 2021): pass the *same* input through the model
twice in training mode. Dropout is stochastic per forward call, so the two passes produce
two different — but semantically identical, since it's the same input — representations.
Those two become a positive pair; every other sequence in the batch becomes a negative.
No data augmentation, no paired dataset needed — dropout noise alone is the augmentation.
