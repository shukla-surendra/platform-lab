# The Real Training Run

Actually executed: `uv run train_lora.py --max-samples 4000 --batch-size 4 --grad-accum 4
--epochs 3` on Apple Silicon MPS.

## Setup

```
[model] trainable params: 4,884,480 || all params: 139,399,488 || trainable%: 3.5039
```

Matches [Chapter 16](../../../docs/llm-engineering/16_fine_tuning_landscape.md#deep-dive-why-peft-specifically-matters-for-this-curriculums-no-gpu-constraint)'s
prediction directly: only 3.5% of the model's parameters were ever trained — every other
weight stayed exactly as SmolLM2-135M's original authors trained it.

- **4,000 training examples** (a random subset of Dolly-15k's ~15,011 rows, shuffled with
  a fixed seed for reproducibility)
- **3 epochs**, effective batch size 16 (`batch_size=4 × grad_accum=4`)
- **750 total optimizer steps**

## Timing — real, observed

```
train_runtime: 3808 seconds (~63.5 minutes)
train_samples_per_second: 3.15
train_steps_per_second: 0.197
```

Slower per-step than [`../../../from_scratch/custom-gpt-6m/`](../../../from_scratch/custom-gpt-6m/)'s
training (~5-6 steps/sec there) — expected and consistent with
[Chapter 16](../../../docs/llm-engineering/16_fine_tuning_landscape.md)'s reasoning:
even with only 3.5% of parameters trainable, every forward/backward pass still runs
through the *entire* 135M-parameter frozen base model (LoRA reduces the **training
memory/gradient** cost, not the per-step **compute** cost of the forward pass itself —
worth being precise about this distinction, since it's a common point of confusion).

## Loss curve — real, logged every 10 steps

## An honest limitation of this run's measurement, worth naming directly

Unlike [`../../../from_scratch/custom-gpt-6m/`](../../../from_scratch/custom-gpt-6m/)'s
training loop (which computes a separate, smoothed `val_loss` on held-out data every
`eval_interval` steps — see
[`../../../from_scratch/custom-gpt-6m/docs/READING_TRAINING_OUTPUT.md`](../../../from_scratch/custom-gpt-6m/docs/READING_TRAINING_OUTPUT.md#train-2395-and-val-2465--the-smoothed-periodic-evaluation-losses)),
`train_lora.py` (like the sibling
[`../../tinyllama-1.1b-lora/train_tinyllama_lora.py`](../../tinyllama-1.1b-lora/train_tinyllama_lora.py)
it's modeled on) only logs raw, per-batch training loss — no held-out validation set was
configured for this run. This is a real, honest gap:

- **What this loss curve tells you**: training is proceeding (loss dropped from ~2.6 to
  ~2.0-2.15 and largely plateaued there), and nothing pathological happened (no NaN, no
  runaway increase).
- **What this loss curve does NOT tell you**: whether the model is overfitting the
  specific 4,000 training examples rather than genuinely generalizing — per
  [Chapter 4](../../../docs/llm-engineering/04_hyperparameter_tuning.md#using-trainloss-vs-testloss-as-your-tuning-feedback-signal)'s
  train/val gap diagnostic, that question requires a held-out set this run didn't
  measure against.

**Why [`BEFORE_AFTER_COMPARISON.md`](BEFORE_AFTER_COMPARISON.md) is the evaluation that
actually matters here**: per
[Chapter 20](../../../docs/llm-engineering/20_evaluating_a_fine_tuned_model.md#why-lossperplexity-alone-is-a-weaker-signal-here-than-it-was-for-pretraining),
loss alone is a weaker signal for a fine-tuned instruction-following model than for
pretraining — the qualitative, side-by-side comparison is what actually answers "did this
work," and that comparison's prompts were never part of the 4,000-example training set,
giving real (if informal) evidence the improvement generalizes beyond memorized training
examples.
