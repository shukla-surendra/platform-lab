# Small vLLM server: SmolLM2-135M-Instruct

This self-contained serving project exposes the small, instruction-tuned
[`HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct`](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct)
checkpoint through an OpenAI-compatible API. It has 135M parameters, so it is a good
first model for a modest GPU or CPU. The first run downloads the model from Hugging
Face into the normal Hugging Face cache.

`serve.py` detects the fastest usable local backend:

| Hardware detected | Server | Model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NVIDIA CUDA | vLLM | `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct` |
| Apple Silicon / MPS | vLLM-Metal | `mlx-community/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct` |
| No supported accelerator | Transformers CPU fallback | `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct` |

Apple MPS does not execute ordinary CUDA vLLM kernels. The MPS path uses
vLLM-Metal—the vLLM hardware plugin backed by MLX/Metal—and the official MLX Community
conversion of the same Hugging Face model; it still provides the same OpenAI-compatible
API.

The Apple dependency intentionally installs `vllm-metal[vllm]`: the `[vllm]` extra is
what brings in vLLM core and the `vllm` command-line executable, in addition to the
Metal plugin.

The regular PyPI `vllm` wheel is CUDA-oriented. Its CPU backend needs a separate
CPU-wheel/source-build procedure, so this project deliberately uses a small
Transformers server on CPU instead. This makes the project runnable on CPU-only Linux
and WSL while retaining vLLM where its accelerated backends are available.

## Run it

From this directory, install the matching optional dependency once.

```bash
cd serving/vllm-smollm2-135m

# The Make target detects CUDA, Apple Silicon, or CPU and installs the matching backend.
make install

# Or explicitly install CUDA vLLM
uv sync --extra vllm

# Apple Silicon macOS instead (native arm64 Python 3.12)
# vLLM-Metal requires native arm64 Python 3.12.
uv sync --extra metal

# CPU-only Linux / WSL instead
uv sync --extra cpu
```

Or use the included Make targets:

```bash
make install       # automatically selects CUDA, Metal, or CPU dependencies
make check         # print selected backend and model
make serve         # start with automatic detection
```

`make install` detects native Apple Silicon and installs vLLM-Metal; detects an NVIDIA
GPU and installs vLLM; otherwise it installs the CPU fallback. At runtime, `make serve`
then selects CUDA when PyTorch can see an NVIDIA GPU, MPS/Metal on Apple Silicon, or
CPU when neither accelerator is usable. `make help` lists every available target,
including `make serve-cuda`, `make serve-mps`, and `make serve-cpu`.

Check what the launcher will use, then start it:

```bash
uv run python serve.py --check
uv run python serve.py
```

The default address is `http://127.0.0.1:8004`. Override it with `--host` / `--port`
or the `HOST` / `PORT` environment variables. The endpoint is local-only by default;
use `--host 0.0.0.0` only when you deliberately need LAN access.

To force a backend for debugging:

```bash
uv run python serve.py --backend cuda
uv run python serve.py --backend mps
uv run python serve.py --backend cpu
```

## Query it

After the server says it is ready:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8004/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Give a one-sentence description of vLLM."}],
    "max_tokens": 80,
    "temperature": 0.2
  }'
```

On the Apple path, send `"model": "mlx-community/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct"` instead.
Both servers expose the standard `/v1/models` endpoint if you want to discover the
loaded model programmatically.

## Notes

- CUDA is selected only when `torch.cuda.is_available()` is true; the launcher will not
  accidentally fall back after a broken GPU setup.
- CPU mode is functional but slower than CUDA; it uses the project’s lightweight
  Transformers/OpenAI-compatible server rather than trying to run a CUDA vLLM wheel.
- The CUDA settings reserve only 55% of GPU memory and cap context at 2048 tokens. They
  are deliberately small defaults; raise them once the basic server is working.

## Known issues

- **vLLM-Metal currently fails to install on every real Mac** (confirmed 2026-08-20,
  `uv sync --extra metal`): vLLM-Metal's `[vllm]` extra needs vanilla `vllm` (for the
  `vllm` CLI vLLM-Metal registers itself with as a plugin), and as of `vllm==0.27.1`
  on PyPI, its base install unconditionally depends on `nvidia-cudnn-frontend` and
  `nvidia-cutlass-dsl` — neither has ever published a macOS wheel (they wrap CUDA
  libraries that only make sense on NVIDIA hardware), and `vllm`'s own metadata has
  no platform marker excluding them on Darwin. This is an upstream vLLM PyPI
  packaging gap, not something fixable from this project's `pyproject.toml`.
  `make install`/`serve.py --backend auto` detect this automatically (checking for
  the `vllm` CLI rather than assuming the extra installed) and fall back to the CPU
  server, so `make install && make serve` still works end-to-end on Apple Silicon
  today — just via CPU/Transformers, not vLLM-Metal. `make serve-mps` remains
  available to force the Metal path once/if upstream fixes this. Confirmed (2026-08-20):
  forcing `--backend mps` and a bare `uv sync --extra metal` both still fail with the
  identical `nvidia-cudnn-frontend` wheel error — only the CPU path is currently
  functional on Apple Silicon, full stop.

- **CUDA path — real GPU test, in progress (2026-08-20, on a GCP `g2-standard-4`/L4,
  see `infra/gcp-gpu-node/docs/training_sop.md` Session 3 for how that box was
  provisioned).** `uv sync --extra vllm` installs cleanly on Linux (confirms the
  macOS issue above really is platform-specific, not a project or vLLM-wide bug).
  Two real startup bugs found while getting a serve attempt healthy, neither specific
  to this project's code:
  1. **Python 3.10 venv**: `vllm serve` crashed at model-init time with
     `TypeError: 'type' object is not subscriptable` inside
     `flashinfer/comm/fd_exchange.py` (`array.array[int]` used as a type annotation —
     `array.array` has no `__class_getitem__`, so this only works under deferred
     annotation evaluation, which that file doesn't opt into). Not something to fix
     in this project — worked around by re-syncing with a newer interpreter:
     `uv sync --extra vllm --python 3.12`.
  2. **Missing C++ toolchain**: past that, `vllm serve` failed again — `flashinfer`
     JIT-compiles a CUDA sampling kernel via `ninja`+`gcc` on first use, and the GCP
     `common-cu129-ubuntu-2204-nvidia-580` boot image ships `gcc` without `g++`:
     `gcc: fatal error: cannot execute 'cc1plus': execvp: No such file or directory`.
     Same category of gap as `infra/gcp-gpu-node/docs/training_sop.md`'s
     `python3.10-dev`/`torch.compile` finding — the boot image has a C compiler but
     not a full build toolchain. Fixed: `sudo apt-get install -y g++`.
  **Not yet confirmed working end-to-end** — the retry after installing `g++` was
  still in `torch.compile`/CUDA-graph-capture warmup (this model's first vLLM CUDA
  cold start took several minutes even for 135M params) when this session paused the
  test deliberately, to avoid contending for GPU time/memory with the `custom-gpt-153m`
  training run active on the same box. Next session: re-run
  `uv run --no-sync python serve.py --backend cuda` in
  `~/tiny_llm/serving/vllm-smollm2-135m` on that box (both fixes above should already
  be in place — Python 3.12 venv + `g++` installed) and confirm a real
  `/v1/chat/completions` response before calling the CUDA path verified.
