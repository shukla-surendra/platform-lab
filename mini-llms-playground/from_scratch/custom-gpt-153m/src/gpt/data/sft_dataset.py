"""Turn-aware tokenization and masked batch construction for SFT.

Unlike the pretraining path (dataset.py's get_batch(), random windows over a flat
uint16 memmap with no notion of turn boundaries), SFT needs to know exactly which
tokens are an Assistant turn's, so masked_next_token_loss() (dataset.py) can zero out
gradient from everything else (System/User turns, and the prompt in general) — the
"real SFT" mechanism this project didn't have before (see sft_prepare.py's docstring).

The SFT corpus is small enough (tens of thousands of conversations, not billions of
tokens) to tokenize once and hold fully in memory as a list of (ids, is_assistant)
arrays, unlike the pretraining corpus's disk-backed memmap.

    Right-padding (not generate_text_batch()'s left-padding) means position 0 is real
    content for every row, so there is no fully-masked-query-row NaN case to guard
    against here — that guard in generate_text_batch exists specifically for
    left-padding's empty-prefix rows, which right-padded training batches never have.

    `fixed_len` (recommended for MPS): pad every batch to this SAME length instead of
    each batch's own max. This corpus's example lengths vary hugely (22-1024 tokens),
    so per-batch dynamic padding gives nearly every step a different tensor shape —
    MPS's caching allocator does not coalesce/reclaim old-shape blocks the way CUDA's
    does, so allocation grows effectively unbounded across a shape-varying run
    (observed: MPS OOM after ~11-23GB of accumulated allocation training a 153M model
    at batch_size=2, which should need a small fraction of that). A single constant
    shape for the whole run means MPS allocates once and reuses it — this is the
    documented fix, not a workaround. sft_trainer.py passes fixed_len=ctx_len; leave it
    None only on backends without this issue (e.g. CUDA), where per-batch dynamic
    padding is the more efficient default.
