# Training this model on a rented GPU

This project's defaults target **one 24 GB GPU for roughly a day**, not a laptop —
unlike the sibling `custom-gpt-{10m,50m}` projects, whose `batch_size=1` exists for
MPS. Everything below is what those defaults are, why, and the order to do things in
so that billed hours go to training rather than to setup.

This project is a fork of `custom-gpt-350m`, hardened specifically for multi-node
DDP: the DDP mechanism (verified with `scripts/ddp_smoke_test.py` — a real 2-rank
CPU/gloo run, loss decreasing, clean checkpoint save/load, no rank races) plus
world-size-aware `GPT_TARGET_TOKENS` sizing (see "Knobs" below) and the
"Multi-Node DDP on a Single AZ" section further down, which the un-forked sibling
project doesn't have.

## The sizing decision

Chinchilla-optimal training is about **20 tokens per parameter** (`C ≈ 6ND`, `D ≈ 20N`,
so `N = sqrt(C/120)`). Turning a wall-clock budget into a model size:

| Budget @ 25% MFU on an L4 | Optimal params | Tokens needed |
|---|---|---|
| 12 h | ~104M | 2.1B |
| 24 h | ~148M | 3.0B |

This project departs from that table's implied sizing, and on purpose: it trades some
token budget for a longer, RoPE-enabled context instead of chasing an exact
Chinchilla ratio. The actual numbers are **201.8M parameters** (`E=896, L=18, C=2048`)
and a **4.92B-token** budget — ~24 tokens/param, a little past Chinchilla-optimal
rather than under it, priced by [`AWS_RUNBOOK.md`](../../../docs/AWS_RUNBOOK.md)'s
cost sheet at roughly **44-55 GPU-hours** (~$35-45 on-demand) depending on measured
MFU — run `gpt-benchmark` to pin the real number down for your card, not this estimate.

`E=896` is not an arbitrary round number either: this architecture's own vocabulary
(32,768, versus the GPT-2-style siblings' 50,257 — see `ARCHITECTURE.md`) and SwiGLU
MLP shift where transformer blocks overtake the token embedding in parameter share.
`make config` shows this preset sitting well past that crossover — blocks ~85.5%,
embedding ~14.5% (versus the 153m sibling's 74.2%/25.3%, whose GELU MLP and 1.5x
larger vocabulary push the crossover to a higher `E`). See
[`MODEL_SIZING_GUIDE.md`](MODEL_SIZING_GUIDE.md) for that derivation in full — it
predates this architecture change and its numeric example still reflects the 153m
sibling rather than this project's own SwiGLU/RoPE shape.

**The budget is implied, not declared.** A step is one *micro-batch*, so:

```
tokens = steps x batch_size x context_length = 150,000 x 16 x 2048 = 4.92B
```

Changing `batch_size` without changing `steps` silently rescales the entire run — and
also reshapes the LR schedule, since warmup is `2% of steps`. `gpt-train` prints the
resolved budget at startup for exactly this reason; read that line before walking away.

## Instance choice

| | GPU | bf16 | TF32 | ~$/hr | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `g4ad.xlarge` | AMD Radeon Pro V520 | — | — | 0.38 | **Unusable.** RDNA1; ROCm never supported it, so PyTorch finds no GPU and silently trains on 4 vCPUs. |
| `g4dn.xlarge` | NVIDIA T4 (Turing) | ✗ | ✗ | 0.53 | Marginal. No bf16 and no TF32, so `runtime.py`'s `set_float32_matmul_precision("high")` is a no-op and fp16 would need a GradScaler. |
| **`g6.xlarge`** | **NVIDIA L4 (Ada)** | ✓ | ✓ | **0.80** | **Recommended.** Lower bandwidth than the A10G (300 vs 600 GB/s) but the same code path and cheaper. |
| `g5.xlarge` | NVIDIA A10G (Ampere) | ✓ | ✓ | 1.01 | Equivalent; pick on price/availability. |

`precision="auto"` resolves to **bf16 on CUDA** and fp32 everywhere else. bf16 rather
than fp16 deliberately: it keeps fp32's exponent range, so no `GradScaler` and no
silent gradient underflow. Ampere and Ada have it; Turing does not.

## Why the corpus lives in a `.bin`

The obvious implementation — tokenize the corpus into one tensor on the training
device — does not survive this scale, in two independent ways:

* `torch.tensor(ids)` is **int64**. This project's 4.92B-token budget = **~39 GB**,
  well past a 24 GB card.
* `load_text` builds one Python `str` first — **~20 GB** at this scale, on a
  g6.xlarge with **16 GB** of system RAM.

Either OOMs before step 0. So `gpt-tokenize` streams the corpus into a flat **uint16**
file (this project's own 32,768-token vocabulary — like the GPT-2-style siblings'
50,257 — fits comfortably in uint16) and training memmaps it: 2 bytes per token,
~9.8 GB on disk for the 4.92B-token budget, near-zero resident memory because only
the sampled windows page in. It also means tokenization happens **once**, not on
every launch and crash-restart of an hourly-billed machine.

Chunked tokenization is verified to produce a **byte-identical token stream** to
tokenizing the whole file at once. That is not free: cutting a chunk mid-word stops BPE
forming merges across the cut (measured at **+24% tokens** of pure noise on a test
corpus), and cutting through a literal `<|endoftext|>` destroys the document boundary
it exists to provide. `dataset.py` only ever cuts at a separator, carrying an
incomplete tail forward.

## Runbook

Do steps 1-3 **locally**, before renting anything.

```bash
# 1. Sanity-check the config — confirm 201,769,344 params and the token budget
make config

# 2. Train THIS PROJECT'S OWN tokenizer first — unlike the GPT-2-style siblings,
#    its 32,768-vocabulary is not something you can skip straight past. Do this
#    before `make tokenize`, always (see docs/DATA_LAYOUT.md).
make tokenizer

# 3. Put the corpus in place as data/train.txt + data/test.txt, then tokenize once.
#    Verify the printed token count is what you expect BEFORE paying for a GPU.
make tokenize

# 4. Smoke-test the loop on a laptop with env overrides — no code edit needed
GPT_PRESET=tiny GPT_BATCH_SIZE=4 GPT_GRAD_ACCUM=2 GPT_STEPS=40 \
  GPT_EVAL_INTERVAL=20 GPT_SAVE_EVERY=20 uv run gpt-train
```

On the instance:

```bash
# 5. Copy the .bin files up (NOT the .txt — the .bin is half the size and
#    re-tokenizing on a rented GPU is wasted money) AND the trained tokenizer —
#    this project's vocabulary is its own, so a .bin without it is meaningless.
scp data/train.bin data/test.bin tokenizer/tokenizer.json  <instance>:.../

# 6. Confirm the GPU is what you think it is
nvidia-smi
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(), torch.cuda.is_bf16_supported())"

# 7. Train. Check the startup banner says bf16 and the expected token budget.
make train
```

## Measure before you commit: `gpt-benchmark`

Every hour and dollar estimate on this page assumes **25% MFU**. Don't trust it —
measure it. `gpt-benchmark` runs the real training step (same `get_batch`, autocast,
forward, backward, optimizer) and turns wall-clock into a costed plan:

```
   0 .. warmup     discarded   CUDA context, cuDNN autotune, allocator growth and
                               clock ramp all land here; counting them understates
                               steady state badly
   warmup .. end   measured    tokens/sec -> tokens/GPU-day -> hours and $ per budget
```

```bash
# The real thing: 10 min warm-up, 50 min measured (matches the default)
gpt-benchmark

# Before the corpus exists — throughput doesn't depend on token *values*
gpt-benchmark --synthetic

# Find the largest batch that fits, and whether bigger is actually faster
gpt-benchmark --sweep-batch 8,16,24,32 --warmup-min 2 --measure-min 5

# Sanity-check the tool itself on a laptop in under a minute
gpt-benchmark --preset tiny --warmup-min 0.1 --measure-min 0.3 --synthetic
```

It prints measured steps/sec, tokens/sec, tokens/GPU-day, **peak VRAM**, and MFU
(when the GPU is in its table), then a projection table over 1B/2B/3B/4.92B/5B/10B
token budgets with GPU-hours, wall clock and cost — priced automatically for a
recognised GPU, or via `--price-per-hour`. A final table inverts the question: for
6/12/24/48 hours, how many tokens fit, what tokens-per-parameter that gives this
model, and what model size that compute budget would be *Chinchilla-optimal* for.

Two deliberate choices worth knowing:

- **Eval and checkpointing are not run.** They are real costs but *configurable*
  ones, and folding them into a hardware measurement makes it untransferable. They
  are added back analytically with `--eval-overhead` (default 5%).
- **MFU uses the standard `6N` approximation.** Attention's score/context matmuls
  don't scale with parameter count but do scale with context, adding a further ~25%
  of FLOPs at this project's `ctx=2048` (versus ~16% for the 153m sibling's `ctx=1024`)
  — reported separately rather than silently folded in or dropped.

**Peak VRAM is the number to read first.** This project's `batch_size=16` default is
**unmeasured** — the 153m sibling's ~10 GB estimate does not transfer (deeper model,
2x the context length). The `batch x seq x vocab` logits tensor alone is
`16 x 2048 x 32,768` — ~2.0 GB in bf16 before counting activations, weights or
optimizer state. `--sweep-batch` settles the real number in minutes and tells you
whether to go up or down before you commit a day of billed time.

## Knobs, without editing code

| Env var | Field | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `GPT_BATCH_SIZE` | `batch_size` | Raise if VRAM allows; **adjust `GPT_STEPS` to match** |
| `GPT_GRAD_ACCUM` | `grad_accum_steps` | Effective batch = batch x accum |
| `GPT_STEPS` | `steps` | The token budget |
| `GPT_TARGET_TOKENS` | `steps` (derived) | Set a token target directly instead of hand-computing `steps` — takes precedence over `GPT_STEPS`, and correctly divides by `world_size` under DDP/FSDP (see "Multi-Node DDP on a Single AZ" below) |
| `GPT_PARALLELISM` | `parallelism` | `ddp` (default) or `fsdp` — irrelevant at world_size=1. See [`docs/DISTRIBUTED_TRAINING.md`](DISTRIBUTED_TRAINING.md) |
| `GPT_LR` / `GPT_MIN_LR` | `lr` / `min_lr` | |
| `GPT_PRECISION` | `precision` | `auto` \| `bf16` \| `fp16` \| `fp32` |
| `GPT_EVAL_INTERVAL` | `eval_interval` | Telemetry only; safe to change between resumes |
| `GPT_SAVE_EVERY` | `save_every_steps` | A checkpoint is ~2.4 GB here |
| `GPT_PRESET` | architecture | `tiny` for smoke tests |

## Known gaps

- **VRAM at `batch_size=16` is unmeasured on real hardware**, not merely
  unoptimized — the `batch x seq x vocab` = `16 x 2048 x 32,768` logits tensor
  (~2.0 GB in bf16) is the largest single known item, but total peak has not been
  benchmarked on an actual GPU. It has only been run at `batch_size=1` on MPS
  locally. Watch `nvidia-smi` on the first real step and drop the batch if it is
  tight.
- **No `torch.compile`.** Likely a further speedup; untested here.
- **DDP and FSDP mechanisms verified locally (CPU/gloo, 2 ranks), not yet on real
  multi-node GPU hardware.** `scripts/ddp_smoke_test.py` and
  `scripts/fsdp_smoke_test.py` both confirm gradients sync/parameters shard
  correctly, loss decreases, and — for FSDP specifically — a full save-then-resume
  round trip actually works (verified directly: a second pass resumes past the
  first pass's step, not from 0). None of that is a measurement of real cross-node
  scaling efficiency on two actual L4 instances. Run a short real 2-node smoke test
  (a few hundred steps) before trusting any numbers in "Multi-Node DDP on a Single
  AZ" below for a paid, multi-hour run. See
  [`docs/DISTRIBUTED_TRAINING.md`](DISTRIBUTED_TRAINING.md) for the full mechanism
  writeup, including two real bugs hit and fixed building this.
- **`get_batch` samples windows uniformly at random**, so "epochs" are an estimate
  (`est_epoch`), not a real pass over shuffled data.

## Multi-Node DDP on a Single AZ

This section is specific to this fork — the un-forked `custom-gpt-350m` sibling has
the same DDP code in `trainer.py`/`cli/train.py` but neither a smoke test nor this
runbook.

### What's actually needed, mechanism by mechanism

| Piece | What it does | Where it comes from |
|---|---|---|
| **`torch.distributed`** | Process-group creation, the collective ops (all-reduce) DDP calls under the hood | Ships with PyTorch — no extra install |
| **`DistributedDataParallel`** | Wraps the model, broadcasts initial weights once, registers the backward hooks that all-reduce gradients | `torch.nn.parallel` — already wired in `trainer.py` |
| **NCCL** | The actual collective-communication backend for GPU-to-GPU transfers | Ships with the CUDA-enabled PyTorch wheel; auto-selected in `cli/train.py` when CUDA is available |
| **`torchrun`** | The standard launcher: sets `RANK`/`WORLD_SIZE`/`LOCAL_RANK` per process, handles rendezvous between nodes | Ships with PyTorch (`torch.distributed.run`) |
| **A rendezvous point** | Every node needs to find every other node — simplest form is one node's private IP + a free port (`--master_addr`/`--master_port`) | No extra service needed at 2 nodes; larger jobs might use `etcd` or a shared filesystem instead |
| **A network path with no NAT/firewall in the way** | NCCL needs the `--master_port` (and the ephemeral ports it negotiates) reachable between both instances | An AWS security group rule, see below |
| **Placement: same AZ** | Keeps the gradient all-reduce on the fast, free, low-latency path | An EC2 subnet/AZ choice, not software |

Nothing here needs EFA, a placement group, or a fabric manager at 2 GPUs — those
matter once you're coordinating dozens of nodes. At this scale it's genuinely just
`torch.distributed` + NCCL + `torchrun` + one open port between two instances in the
same AZ.

### AWS setup, concretely

**This is now Terraform, not a manual click-through**:
[`infra/aws-gpu-node-multi/`](../../../infra/aws-gpu-node-multi/README.md) provisions
exactly the setup described below — two `g6.xlarge` instances, same subnet/AZ, the
inter-node security-group rules, corpus/tokenizer/checkpoint sync, and a
`~/launch_ddp.sh` on each node pre-filled with the correct `--node_rank` and
`--master_addr`. The manual steps below are what that module does under the hood, if
you want to understand or replicate it by hand instead.

> **First real run (2026-08-31, us-east-1):** `g6.xlarge` hit
> `Server.InsufficientInstanceCapacity` region-wide, so this run actually launched on
> `g5.xlarge` (A10G, same bf16/TF32 capability, same "G and VT" quota family) instead
> — see the infra module's own
> ["Real deployment log"](../../../infra/aws-gpu-node-multi/README.md#real-deployment-log-2026-08-31-us-east-1)
> for the full quota/capacity debugging story and how to diagnose it fast via
> CloudTrail next time, rather than waiting on Terraform's retry loop.

1. **Launch both `g6.xlarge` instances in the same Availability Zone** (e.g. both in
   `us-east-1a`, not one in `1a` and one in `1b`). This is the single highest-leverage
   decision here — see cost section below for why.
2. **Same security group, one rule added**: allow inbound TCP on the `torchrun`
   master port (e.g. `29500`) from the other instance's private IP (or from the
   security group itself, so it's symmetric and survives instance replacement).
3. **Use private IPs, not public ones**, for `--master_addr` — public-IP traffic
   between two instances in the same AZ still typically routes through the IGW,
   adding latency and, depending on setup, cost that private-IP same-AZ traffic
   never incurs.
4. Confirm both instances actually see each other before spending GPU time on it:
   ```bash
   # From node 1:
   nc -zv <node0-private-ip> 29500   # from node 1 to itself, or reverse from node 2
   ```

### Launch commands

```bash
# Node 0 (rank 0):
torchrun --nnodes=2 --node_rank=0 --nproc_per_node=1 \
  --master_addr=<node0-private-ip> --master_port=29500 \
  -m gpt.cli.train

# Node 1 (rank 1) — identical except node_rank:
torchrun --nnodes=2 --node_rank=1 --nproc_per_node=1 \
  --master_addr=<node0-private-ip> --master_port=29500 \
  -m gpt.cli.train
```

Both nodes need the same tokenized `.bin` files and the same `tokenizer/tokenizer.json`
(step 5 of the Runbook above, scp'd to *both* instances) — DDP replicates the model,
not the data pipeline; each rank reads its own local copy of the corpus.

### Sizing the run: token budget, not step count

Set `GPT_TARGET_TOKENS` (not `GPT_STEPS`) — it's world-size-aware (see "Knobs" above),
so the same command is correct whether launched with `world_size=1` on a laptop or
`world_size=2` across both nodes:

```bash
GPT_TARGET_TOKENS=4000000000 GPT_GRAD_ACCUM=64 torchrun ...
```

This model's Chinchilla-optimal budget (20N against 347.36M params) is ~6.95B
tokens — but the real corpus in `data/train.bin` (books + cosmopedia, tokenized
directly from `../custom-gpt-350m/../_shared_data/raw`, not a placeholder) is
1,015,850,483 train tokens, genuinely smaller than that ideal, with no larger
corpus currently planned. **4B is sized against the corpus that actually exists**,
not the theoretical ideal: ~3.94 epochs over it, inside the ~4-epoch mark this
project's own `DATASET.md` documents as still close-to-fresh (repetition cost
"decays toward worthless" only by ~16 epochs, not at 4). This is what
`infra/aws-gpu-node-multi`'s `target_tokens` variable defaults to, baked into both
nodes' generated `launch_ddp.sh`. Raise it only once the corpus itself grows past
~1B tokens — pushing this number up against the same fixed corpus just buys more
epochs of repetition, not more real signal.

### Why `GPT_GRAD_ACCUM` matters more here than on a single GPU

Every optimizer step, DDP all-reduces the gradient tensor across nodes — but only on
the *last* micro-step of a `grad_accum_steps` window (the others use `no_sync()`,
pure local compute, zero network). Without EFA, that one sync moves the full
gradient tensor over plain TCP, and it's largely *not* hidden by overlap (only the
sync micro-step's own backward pass runs concurrently with it, and that's usually far
shorter than the transfer itself). Raising `grad_accum_steps` amortizes that fixed
sync cost over more sync-free compute — the actual, measurable lever for DDP
efficiency on non-EFA instances, not a knob to leave at its single-GPU default.

### Cost: compute + network

| Item | Estimate | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Compute | 2 × `g6.xlarge` × wall-clock hours × $0.80/hr | Same per-instance rate as the single-GPU table above |
| Network, same AZ | **$0.00** | EC2-to-EC2 traffic within one AZ over private IP is free |
| Network, cross-AZ | Not $0 — real dollars *and* likely worse latency | Charged per GB in each direction at typical inter-AZ rates; also risks invalidating any wall-clock estimate made assuming same-AZ bandwidth |

There's no tradeoff to weigh here: same-AZ is both the free option and the faster
one. Put both instances in the same AZ and this line item is a non-issue.

### Before you commit a paid multi-hour run

1. `scripts/ddp_smoke_test.py` locally (CPU/gloo, minutes, near-$0) — mechanism check.
2. A short *real* 2-node run (a few hundred steps, `GPT_TARGET_TOKENS` set small) —
   measures actual `tokens/sec` under real NCCL/network conditions, which the CPU
   smoke test above cannot tell you.
3. Only then set the real `GPT_TARGET_TOKENS` for the full budget, using measured
   throughput rather than the theoretical numbers in this doc.
